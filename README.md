The goal of this project is to create an end-end marketing strategy plan for the PnG Product Ninjama and its performance and continued success in the French market. 

The problem statement: The bedwetting/enuresis market is significantly underdeveloped, with low market penetration and low repurchase rates. Many households affected by bedwetting do not use suitable products, either because they are unaware of the specialized options or they are disappointed by the "baby diaper" appearance of current products. This results in a large unmet need, as 61% of affected households do not use appropriate products. Additionally, 38% of children feel uncomfortable or embarrassed wearing the current diaper-like options. The market presents a sizable opportunity, with 8% of children aged 4-12 affected by bedwetting, but only 3% using category products. Addressing the tension points around lack of awareness, product dissatisfaction, and stigma could help unlock the potential of this growing segment.

Key highlights of the project:
- Comprehensive analysis of the bedwetting landscape in France, including competitor positioning
- Identification of unique selling points for Ninjamas to launch in the French market
- Creation of a marketing action plan to improve Ninjamas' market share and brand awareness by 2024
- Specific recommendations backed by data from reviews, surveys, and industry reports
- Communication strategy targeting parents, kids, and medical practitioners
- In-store implementation, promotion tactics to encourage product trials, and long-term product portfolio strategies
- Explore ways to increase societal awareness and acceptance of bedwetting
- Use product as a conversation starter and incorporate educational elements into marketing
- Potential partnerships and community connection initiatives to foster support and shift perceptions
